# The Expense Management System will help in managing the users expenses making the work of storing the data in an organized way, saving both time and effort. Information    regarding the type of expense and amount spent can be seen at all times.
# Through this system, the user can digitally maintain a system to track his/her expenses.
# OOPL concepts have been used in this project to perform basic functions like add, delete, and update expenses. 
# The final project is shown to the outside world through GUI interface hiding the background details or implementation.

HOW TO RUN THE CODE. 

# First time running should be done using "ExpenseTracker1stCode.py" 
PLEASE NOTE - connection to MySQL via a XAMPP server is required and the password should be changed.

# From 2nd time onwards, the "ExpenseTracker2ndCode.py" code has to be executed. (This is because the new tables would have already been created and does not require the CREATE TABLE command)
